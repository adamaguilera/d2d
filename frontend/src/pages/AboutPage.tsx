                    Hello ðŸ‘‹ D2Draft is made to help the average Dota 2 player make better hero picks. Most players rely on winrates
                    based on pro level matches which doesn't accurately represent the average player. The tool displays
                    individual hero matchup winrates with a simple interface to improve your drafting skills. Data is kept fresh and
                    updated daily.
